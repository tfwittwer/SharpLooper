# SharpLooper
A C# program for slowing down and looping music, ideal e.g. for learning new songs. It uses the Windows MediaPlayer library.

Use is pretty self-explanatory. You can drag & drop the media file into the file box. The buttons on the bottom are used for controlling playback speed. You can set the start and end points for playback by pressing Set during playback, or by entering them manually and pressing enter.

There are some minor issues. I was not able to read the duration of the file. Moving forward or backward while paused may lead to strange results.
